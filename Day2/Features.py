GIT ?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code.

In simple words: Git tracks every change you make in your project.

# Why Git Was Created?

Before Git:

Developers used ZIP files
Manual backups
“final_final_latest_version2.zip” 
Team collaboration was messy

In 2005,
Linus Torvalds created Git for the development of the Linux kernel.



# What Git Actually Does
Git:

✔ Tracks file changes
✔ Stores history
✔ Allows reverting to old versions
✔ Supports branching
✔ Helps multiple developers collaborate
✔ Merges code

What is Git Bash?

Git Bash is a command-line tool for Windows that allows you to use Git commands.

Why Git Bash Exists?

Windows does not natively support many Linux commands like:
ls ---> list of folders 
pwd --->> present working directory
touch __> to create a new file
rm ---> remove 

Git Bash gives:
✔ Linux-like terminal
✔ Git commands
✔ SSH support
