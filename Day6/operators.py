# Operators ??
# a operator is symbol which to used to perform specific operation on two or more values.

# types of operators :

#Arithmetic operators :

# + , - , * , / ,% ,// ,**

print(10/2) # 5.0 (Q)

print(10//2) # 5

print(10/3) # 3.333333333

print(10//3) # (Q) 


print(9%3) # (R) 

print(3**3)


# comparision operators : compare two values  

# == , < ,> ,<= ,>= ,!= 

print(10==10)  # True

print(12<=10)  # False

# Assignment operator 

# = , += ,-= ,*= ,/= ,//= ,%= ,**=

x = 10

x +=10


# logical operators (boolean output)

# and , or , not 

# and : if both the conditions are True then it is True 
# or : if any one condition is True then it is True 
# not : if True then it will False and vice versaa 


# memebership operators : 

# in , not in 

# check whether the values exists in sequence 
# it is used in for loop 

n = [1,3,2,4]
print(4 in n)
print(5 in n)


# identity operators 

# is , is not
# 


a=10
b=15
print(a is b)


# Bit wise operator

# it deals with binary code 0's and 1's 

# bitwise AND(&) : if both are 1's then it is 1 
# bitwise OR(|) : atleast one bit is 1 then it is 1 
# bitwise XOR (^) : if same bit value then 0 or else 1
# bitwise right shift(>>) : 
# bitwise left shift(<<) :
